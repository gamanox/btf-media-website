gulp-filter-by
==============

A gulp plugin designed to help filter files from source

## Usage

```js
gulp.src('./**/*.scss')
    .pipe(filterBy(function(file) {
        return file.contents.toString().indexOf('@import "partialName"') > -1;
    }))
    .pipe(sass())
```

### filterBy(fn)

Will filter files based on the boolean return value of the provided `fn` function

#### fn

The required `fn` function is executed by the `filterBy` plugin, and it is passed the `file` from the stream; 
it is then up to the developer of the task to decide whether the `file` should be included into the stream by 
performing any desired computations; the only requirement is that the function returns a boolean value to the 
plugin, so that it knows how to process the `file`:
 
- returning `true` will include the file into the stream.
- returning `false` will exclude the file from the stream.
